Hello! 👋 My name is **Dorian B**. Originally from Hamilton ON, now residing in Regina SK to pursue a BS in Computer Science! 🖥

I have a huge interest in all things technology, focused on hardware and security 👨‍💻. Currently in my 3rd year of study, I have studied C++, Java, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, AJAX, and more.

Currently a night time security guard 💂 working full time, while going to school full time. Life never slows down 💪!

I love taking things to their limits and breaking everything else. Slowly on my way into the cyber security field!
